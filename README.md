## Introduction

This is an attempt to create a minimal git-based documentation repository.

## Modus operandi

The idea is that it should be able to be updated by anybody with rudimentary `git` and `markdown` skills.

It should enable internal links and images.

It should be able to be read by anybody with the URL who can use a browser.
